# Passport

Passport is an authentication framework for [Connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/)
and [Express](http://expressjs.com/), which is extensible through "plugins"
known as _strategies_.

Passport is designed to be a general-purpose, yet simple, modular, and
unobtrusive, authentication framework.  Passport's sole purpose is to
authenticate requests.  In being modular, it doesn't force any particular
authentication strategy on your application.  In being unobtrusive, it doesn't
mount routes in your application.  The API is simple: you give Passport a
request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs
when authentication succeeds or fails.

## Installation

    $ npm install passport

## Usage

#### Strategies

Passport uses the concept of strategies to authenticate requests.  Strategies
can range from verifying username and password credentials, delegated
authentication using [OAuth](http://oauth.net/) (for example, via [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/)
or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)), or federated authentication using [OpenID](http://openid.net/).

Before asking passport to authenticate a request, the strategy (or strategies)
used by an application must be configured.

    passport.use(new LocalStrategy(
      function(username, password, done) {
        User.findOne({ username: username, password: password }, function (err, user) {
          done(err, user);
        });
      }
    ));

#### Sessions

Passport will maintain persistent login sessions.  In order for persistent
sessions to work, the authenticated user must be serialized to the session, and
deserialized when subsequent requests are made.

Passport does not impose any restrictions on how your user records are stored.
Instead, you provide a function to Passport which implements the necessary
serialization and deserialization logic.  In typical applications, this will be
as simple as serializing the user ID, and finding the user by ID when
deserializing.

    passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
      done(null, user.id);
    });

    passport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {
      User.findById(id, function (err, user) {
        done(err, user);
      });
    });

#### Connect/Express Middleware

To use Passport in a [Connect](http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/) or
[Express](http://expressjs.com/)-based application, configure it with the
required `passport.initialize()` middleware.  If your applications uses
persistent login sessions (recommended, but not required), `passport.session()`
middleware must also be used.

    app.configure(function() {
      app.use(express.cookieParser());
      app.use(express.bodyParser());
      app.use(express.session({ secret: 'keyboard cat' }));
      app.use(passport.initialize());
      app.use(passport.session());
      app.use(app.router);
      app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../../public'));
    });

#### Authenticate Requests

Passport provides an `authenticate()` function (which is standard
Connect/Express middleware), which is utilized to authenticate requests.

For example, it can be used as route middleware in an Express application:

    app.post('/login', 
      passport.authenticate('local', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/');
      });
